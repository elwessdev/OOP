Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). OOP aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, and more in programming. The main goal is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of code by modeling data as objects that can interact with each other.
